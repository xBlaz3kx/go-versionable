# Go-versionable

A simple package that allows you to create versioned structs in Go.
It is useful when you need to maintain multiple versions of the same struct, keeping the order of the versions.

## Installation

go get github.com/xBlaz3kx/go-versionable@latest
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Simple APIs for adding versions and getting the latest version
- [] Options to limit the number of versions (WIP)
- [] Marshalling and unmarshalling versioned structs to JSON, YAML and BSON
